# üß† Data Extraction & Processing Project ‚Äî Payment Card Fraud Detection (2025)

## üìò Overview
This project focuses on **data extraction, cleaning, processing, and visualization** using the [Payment Card Fraud Detection Dataset (2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/payment-card-fraud-detection-with-ml-models-2025/data).

The main objective is to analyze payment transaction data, identify key patterns of fraudulent activity, and develop a reliable **machine learning pipeline** to classify transactions as *fraudulent* or *legitimate*.  
In addition, a **Power BI dashboard** provides an interactive visualization of fraud trends and model results, accompanied by a **comprehensive analytical report**.

## üîç Project Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
- Downloaded dataset from Kaggle.  
- Loaded the data into Jupyter Notebook using `pandas`.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and data inconsistencies.  
- Encoded categorical variables for model readiness.  
- Normalized numerical columns to improve model performance.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated transaction patterns by type and amount.  
- Visualized fraud vs. non-fraud transaction distribution.  
- Identified feature correlations and outlier behavior.

### 4. Model Building
- Implemented multiple classification algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  
  - XGBoost  
- Performed train-test split and model evaluation.  
- Compared models using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

### 5. Visualization & Reporting
- Built a **Power BI Dashboard** to present fraud insights interactively.  
- Compiled a **final PDF report** summarizing workflow, results, and recommendations.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard Features
- Transaction and fraud detection trends over time  
- Fraud vs. non-fraud transaction comparison  
- Feature-wise fraud likelihood visualization  
- Model performance comparison charts  
- Interactive filters for transaction types and time periods  

---

## üß© Key Insights
- Fraudulent transactions form a **minority class** but show clear behavioral patterns.  
- Feature scaling and data balancing techniques improved prediction accuracy.  
- **Random Forest** delivered the best trade-off between recall and precision.  
- Visualization dashboards help identify suspicious transaction clusters effectively.
